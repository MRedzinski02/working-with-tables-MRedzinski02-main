            So this is the only song off of his album Beerbongs and Bentleys to NOT stick to the hip-hop style that he was known for, and was co-written by his friend and partner-in-crime 
            Andrew Watt. If you guessed Stay, then you're correct, bingo, here it is, Stay by Post Malone.</p></th>

            was called "Family Ties" the cover for that single is actually a family picture with both of them in it, pretty cool story behind that song. You've heard a song from Keem, let's jump to Kendrick,
            here's Silent Hill featuring Kodak Black.

            seeing that behind-the-scenes talent, there's a lot of unsung heroes in the music industry that don't get the credit they deserve. Up next is Cry For Me by Camilla Cabello, and right
            after that we're gonna play a track from the one who actually helped her write the track, let's see if you can take a guess at who it is, here's Cry For Me.

            there is NO way you guessed that without looking it up! Ryan Tedder is the lead singer and songwriter for OneRepublic, that name will probably ring a few more bells, they're known
